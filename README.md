# Interview-Creation-Portal

Live Link: [Interview Creation Portal](https://www.holdmypotion.tech/)

## Description

Create a simple app where admins can create interviews by selecting participants, interview start time and end time

## Basic Requirements

1. An interview creation page where the admin can create an interview by selecting participants, start time and end time. Backend should throw error with proper error message if:
   1. Any of the participants is not available during the scheduled time (i.e, has another interview scheduled)
   2. No of participants is less than 2
2. An interviews list page where admin can see all the upcoming interviews.
3. An interview edit page where admin can edit the created interview with the same validations as on the creation page.

_Note: No need to add a page to create Users/Participants. Create them directly in the database_

## Good to haves

1. Send emails to participants on interview creation.
2. Create your appâ€™s frontend as a [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
3. Option to upload resume

## Submitting

1. Upload your code on github or any other similar service and send us the link to it.
2. Also if possible you can deploy your app using aws/heroku or any other service and send us a link to it.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. All Basic functionality working.
2. Database schema
3. Code quality

## Tech Stack (MERN)

1. React framework
2. NodeJS
3. ExpressJS
4. MongoDB / Mongoose
5. Docker
6. Kubernetes
7. Jest

## Hosting Provider

Digital Ocean - Kubernetes Cluster

## Functional Requirements
